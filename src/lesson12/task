You need to create the following structure:
abstract class Bank and three classes that extends it: USBank, EUBank, ChinaBank
Enum Currency
Class User that represents User of our Bank System
Interface BankSystem and its implementation
Abstract class Bank should contain fields:
long id
String bankCountry
Currency currency
int numberOfEmployees
double avrSalaryOfEmployee
long rating
long totalCapital
Generate getters and setters. And create constructor with all fields.
Methods are:
abstract int getLimitOfWithdrawal()
abstract int getLimitOfFunding()
abstract double getMonthlyRate()
abstract double getCommission(int amount)
double moneyPaidMonthlyForSalary()
Currency is an Enum that has two values: USD, EUR
USBank:
limit of withdrawal = 1000 if currency is USD and 1200 if currency is EUR
limit of funding - 10000 if EUR and no limit if USD
monthly rate - 1% with USD and 2% with EUR
commision - 5% if USD and up to 1000, 7% if USD and more than 1000
6% if EUR and up to 1000 and 8% if EUR and more than 1000
EUBank:
limit of withdrawal = 2000 if currency is USD and 2200 if currency is EUR
limit of funding - 20000 if EUR and 10000 if USD
monthly rate - 0% with USD and 1% with EUR
commision - 5% if USD and up to 1000, 7% if USD and more than 1000
2% if EUR and up to 1000 and 4% if EUR and more than 1000
ChinaBank:
 limit of withdrawal = 100 if currency is USD and 150 if currency is EUR
limit of funding - 5000 if EUR and 10000 if USD
monthly rate - 1% with USD and 0% with EUR
commision - 3% if USD and up to 1000, 5% if USD and more than 1000
10% if EUR and up to 1000 and 11% if EUR and more than 1000
User should have following fields:
long id
String name
double balance
int monthsOfEmployment
String companyName
int salary
Bank bank
Create interface BankSystem with methods:
void withdraw(User user, int amount)
void fund(User user, int amount)
void transferMoney(User fromUser, User toUser, int amount)
void paySalary(User user)
And its implementation UkrainianBankSystem
Create Main class with main method, where you should create 6 Users: 2 of USBank, 2 of EUBank and 2 of ChinaBank. Run four different operations with every Userâ€™s balance and print its objects to console
